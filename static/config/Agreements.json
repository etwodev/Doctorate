The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction.\n \nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. This agreement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from different jurisdictions. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under this Agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.\n \nThe Service is controlled and operated from facilities in Hong Kong. Yostar makes no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable Hong Kong and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use the Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by Hong Kong, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by Hong Kong government. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Service are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in Hong Kong.\n \n15. Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver\n \nA. Governing Law. You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in Hong Kong; and (ii) This Agreement shall be governed by the substantive laws of Hong Kong, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving transnational commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by applicable Hong Kong laws. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to competent Hong Kong courts for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Hong Kong is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.\n \nB. Arbitration. Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Yostar. For any dispute with Yostar, you agree to first contact us at info@Yo-star.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Yostar has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, \"Claims\"), by binding arbitration by HKIAC, under the arbitration rules then in effect for HKIAC, except as provided herein. HKIAC may be contacted at http://www.hkiac.org. The arbitration will be conducted in Hong Kong, unless you and Yostar agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any HKIAC filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with HKIAC rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Yostar from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.\n \nC. Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver. With respect to all persons and entities, regardless of whether they have obtained or used the Service for personal, commercial or other purposes, all claims must be brought in the parties' individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action or other representative proceeding. This waiver applies to class arbitration, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Yostar are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding of any kind.\n \n16. General\n \nA. Assignment. This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Yostar without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.\n \nB. Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement. Yostar may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Yostar in our sole discretion. Yostar reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement.

When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the \"last modified\" date at the bottom of this page and notify you that material changes have been made to the Agreement. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.\n \nC. Entire Agreement/Severability. This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Yostar in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Yostar concerning the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.\n \nD. No Waiver. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Yostar's failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\n \nE.
